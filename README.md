# NzbDrone.HotPatch
Radarr (NzbDrone) Hot Patching to not create sub-directories for Movies.

Using Harmony we're able to hotpatch nzbdrones functionality to make it do what we want it to do, without having to touch the original source code.

This HotPatch will make Radarr not create sub folders for movie files, but instead put all movies inside the root directory.

Still extremely early development.
